    <p>A savoury dish that will blow everyone away, using peanut butter to transform a Thai red curry into a peanut curry.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
    <li>bunch spring onions, sliced</li>
    <li>small bunch coriander, stalks finely chopped, leaves picked</li>
    <li>400g pork tenderloin, sliced</li>
    <li>4 tbsp Thai red curry paste</li>
    <li>4 tbsp peanut butter</li>
    <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
    <li>400ml can light coconut milk</li>
    <li>175g pack baby corn</li>
    <li>juice 1 lime</li>
    <li>steamed jasmine rice, to serve</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large saucepan or flameproof casserole. Add the spring onions and coriander stalks and cook for 1 min. Add the pork slices and cook for 5 mins until starting to brown.</li>
    <li>Stir in the curry paste and peanut butter. After 30 secs, add the sugar, soy and coconut milk, plus ½ can of water. Mix well, put a lid on and leave to simmer for 15 mins, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Remove the lid, add the baby corn and increase the heat. Bubble for 3 mins until the corn is cooked and the sauce has thickened a little. Stir in the lime juice and check the seasoning.
